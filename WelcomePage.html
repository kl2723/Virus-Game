<p><h2>The Story<h2/></p>
<p>Twas a Thursday afternoon when NOVA student <cite>Taco Jr.</cite> had just landed himself a work-study<br>
  job in the Engineering Building, (a small little building across the street from the main one.) Anywho,<br>
  His boss, Dr. D, was showing him the first lab.<br><br><br>

  D: You are in charge of monitoring this room, helping students who need help, updating computers, etc...<br><br>

  Taco: Wait, I'm getting insurance right?<br><br>

  D: Yes.<br><br>

  Taco: Okay sounds fair. (Taco notices something shiny) Ooooooh, what's that over there(pointing to the shiny object)
  <br><br>

  D: That is the most dangerous computer virus known to man. If ou open the box, he will come out and destroy the planet while placing
  you inside a computer. That is how we lost Dr. V. Now anyways...just monitor the area and whatever you <!DOCTYPE html>
  <strong>DONT OPEN THE SHINY BOX</strong> even though its super shiny and if I were you I would probably open it myself but still....Dont open.<br><br>


  So naturally Taco opened the box.

<br><br><br>

And that's how the virus was released and Taco was trapped insode a computer world.  DUN DUN DUN...
